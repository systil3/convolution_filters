    # This script has test cases to help you test your my_filter2D() function. You should verify here that your
    # output is reasonable before using your my_filter2D to construct a hybrid image in hw2.py. The outputs are all
    # saved and you can include them in your writeup. You can add calls to cv2.filter2D() if you want to check that
    # my_filter2D() is doing something similar.

    ## Setup
